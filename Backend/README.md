# Web Scraping for Information on Monkeypox

This Python script is designed to scrape relevant information about Monkeypox from various web pages and compile it into a CSV file. It utilizes the requests library to retrieve HTML content from specified URLs and the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML and extract desired information. The pandas library is then used to organize the data into a DataFrame before exporting it to a CSV file.
