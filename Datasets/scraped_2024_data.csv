https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/if-sick/transmission.html,Close or Intimate Contact,"Regardless of type, mpox virus can spread to anyone through close, personal contact, including: Direct skin-to-skin contact with mpox rash or scabs from a person with mpoxContact with saliva, upper respiratory secretions (snot, mucus), and bodily fluids or lesions around the anus, rectum, or vagina from a person with mpoxPregnant people with mpox can pass the virus to the fetus during pregnancy or to the newborn during and after birth. Direct contact can happen during intimate contact, including: Oral, anal, or vaginal sex, or touching the genitals (penis, testicles, labia, and vagina) or anusHugging, massage, and kissingProlonged face-to-face interactions (such as talking or breathing)"
https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/if-sick/transmission.html,Touching Objects,"Mpox virus can spread to anyone through contact with objects, fabrics, and surfaces that have not been disinfected after use by someone with mpox. This includes items like clothing, bedding, towels, fetish gear, or sex toys."
https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/if-sick/transmission.html,Infected Animals,"Mpox can spread from animals to people in a few ways: Through small wildanimalsin West and Central Africa, where mpox is endemic (found naturally).Direct close contact with an infected animal, fluids or waste, or getting bitten or scratched.During activities like hunting, trapping, or processing infected wild animals in areas where mpox is endemic. People are less likely to get mpox from a pet, but it’s possible. Close contact with a pet that is infected, including petting, cuddling, hugging, kissing, licking, and sharing sleeping spaces or food, can spread mpox to a person. To reduce the risk of spreading mpox between animals and people: Avoid close contact with an animal that might have mpox.Those who have mpox should avoid contact with animals,including pets, to prevent spreading the virus to them."
https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/if-sick/transmission.html,"Can mpox spread through water in pools, hot tubs, or splash pads?","No studies have found a clear link between mpox and water in pools, hot tubs, or splash pads. The mpox virus is killed in water at the chlorine levels recommended for disinfection in recreational water venues by CDC and required by U.S. jurisdictions."
https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/if-sick/transmission.html,Scientists are Still Researching,"How often someone with no symptoms can spread the virusHow mpox virus can be spread through respiratory secretionsWhether mpox can spread through semen, vaginal fluids, urine, or feces"
https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/prevention/sexual-health.html,How can a person lower their risk during sex?,"Vaccinationis an important tool in preventing the spread of mpox. JYNNEOS is a two-dose vaccine developed to protect against mpox. Getting both doses provides the best protection against mpox. People who have only received one dose should receive a second dose, even if it has been longer than 28 days since their first dose. If you are at risk for mpox but haven’t received your two-dose vaccine yet, temporarily changing some parts of your sex life might reduce the risk of exposure to the virus. Reducing or avoiding behaviors that increase risk of mpox exposure is also important when you are between your first and second shots of vaccine. Your protection will be highest two weeks after your second dose of vaccine. Make a habit of exchanging contact information with any new partner to allow for sexual health follow-up, if needed. Talk with your partner about anympox symptomsand be aware of any new or unexplained rash or lesion on either of your bodies, including the mouth, genitals (penis, testicles, vulva, or vagina), or anus (butthole). If you or your partner has or recently hadmpox symptoms, or you have a new or unexplained rash anywhere on your body, do not have sex and see a healthcare provider. In some cases, symptoms may be mild, and some people may not even know they have mpox. If you or a partner has mpox or think you may have mpox, the best way to protect yourself and others is to avoid sex of any kind (oral, anal, vaginal) and kissing or touching each other’s bodies while you are sick.Especially avoid touching any rash. Do not share things like towels, fetish gear, sex toys, and toothbrushes. Even if you feel well, here are some ways to reduce your chances of being exposed to mpox if you are sexually active: Take a temporary break from activities that increase exposure to mpox until you are two weeks after your second dose. This will greatly reduce your risk.Limit your number of sex partners to reduce your likelihood of exposure.Spaces like back rooms, saunas, sex clubs, or private and public sex parties, where intimate, often anonymous sexual contact with multiple partners occurs—are more likely to spread mpox.Condoms (latex or polyurethane) may protect your anus (butthole), mouth, penis, or vagina from exposure to mpox. However, condoms alone may not prevent all exposures to mpox since the rash can occur on other parts of the body.Gloves (latex, polyurethane, or nitrile) might also reduce the possibility of exposure if inserting fingers or hands into the vagina or the anus. The gloves must cover all exposed skin and be removed carefully to avoid touching the outer surface.Avoid kissing or exchanging spit since mpox can spread this way.Masturbate together at a distance without touching each other and without touching any rash.Have virtual sex with no in-person contact.Consider having sex with your clothes on or covering areas where rash is present, reducing as much skin-to-skin contact as possible. Leather or latex gear also provides a barrier to skin-to-skin contact; just be sure to change or clean clothes/gear between partners and after use.Be aware that mpox can also spread through respiratory secretions with close, face-to-face contact.Remember to wash your hands, fetish gear, sex toys, and any fabrics (bedding, towels, clothes) after having sex.Learn moreabout infection control."
https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/prevention/sexual-health.html,What should a person do if they have a new or unexplained rash or other symptoms?,"Avoid sex or being intimate with anyone until you have been checked out by a healthcare provider.If you don’t have a provider or health insurance, visit a public health clinic near you.When you see a healthcare provider, wear a mask, and remind them that this virus is circulating in the area.Avoid gatherings, especially if they involve close, personal, skin-to-skin contact. Think about the people you have had close, personal, or sexual contact during the last 21 days, including people you met through dating apps. To help stop the spread, you might be asked to share this information if you have received an mpox diagnosis."
https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/prevention/sexual-health.html,"How can a person lower the chance of getting mpox at places like raves, parties, clubs, and festivals?","When thinking about how to lower the chance of getting mpox at places like raves, parties, clubs, and festivals: Seek out information about mpox in your area from trusted sources like your local health department.Vaccination is an important tool in stopping the spread of mpox. Get your two-dose vaccine before attending any gathering where mpox may be present.Consider how much close, personal, skin-to-skin contact is likely to occur at the event you plan to attend.If you feel sick or have a rash, do not attend any gathering, and see a healthcare provider. All Social Gatherings Are Not the Same Festivals, events, and concerts where attendees are fully clothed and unlikely to share skin-to-skin contact are safer. However, attendees should be mindful of activities (like kissing) that might spread mpox.A rave, party, or club where there is minimal clothing and where there is direct, personal, often skin-to-skin contact has some risk. Avoid any rash you see on others and consider minimizing skin-to-skin contact.Enclosed spaces, such as back rooms, saunas, sex clubs, or private and public sex parties where intimate, often anonymous sexual contact with multiple partners occurs, may have a higher likelihood of spreading mpox."
https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/symptoms/index.html,Mpox symptoms,"People with mpox often get a rash that may be located on hands, feet, chest, face, or mouth or near the genitals, including penis, testicles, labia, and vagina, and anus.  The incubation period is 3–17 days. During this time, a person does not have symptoms and may feel fine. The rash will go through several stages, including scabs, before healing.The rash can initially look like pimples or blisters and may be painful or itchy. Other symptoms of mpox can include FeverChillsSwollen lymph nodesExhaustionMuscle aches and backacheHeadacheRespiratory symptoms (e.g., sore throat, nasal congestion, or cough) You may experience all or only a few symptoms."
https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/symptoms/index.html,How long do mpox symptoms last?,"Typically, mpox symptoms start within 21 days of exposure to the virus. If you have flu-like symptoms, you will likely develop a rash 1–4 days later. If you have symptoms, such as a rash, visit a healthcare provider. A person with mpox can spread it to others from the time symptoms start until the rash has fully healed and a fresh layer of skin has formed. New data show that some people can spread mpox to others from one to four days before their symptoms appear. It’s not clear how many people this has affected during the ongoing global outbreak that began in 2022. There is currently no evidence showing that people who never have symptoms have spread the virus to someone else. CDC will continue to monitor the latest information abouthow mpox spreads."

https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox,Key facts,"Mpox (monkeypox) is a viral illness caused by the monkeypox virus, a species of the genus Orthopoxvirus. Two different clades exist: clade I and clade IICommon symptoms of mpox are a skin rash or mucosal lesions which can last 2–4 weeks accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes.Mpox can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with someone who is infectious, with contaminated materials, or with infected animals.Laboratory confirmation of mpox is done by testing skin lesion material by PCR.Mpox is treated with supportive care. Vaccines and therapeutics developed for smallpox and approved for use in some countries can be used for mpox in some circumstances.In 2022–2023 a global outbreak of mpox was caused by a strain known as clade IIb.Mpox can be prevented by avoiding physical contact with someone who has mpox. Vaccination can help prevent infection for people at risk."
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox,Overview,"Mpox (monkeypox) is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus. It can cause a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes and fever. Most people fully recover, but some get very sick. Anyone can get mpox. It spreads from contact with infected: persons, through touch, kissing, or sexanimals, when hunting, skinning, or cooking themmaterials, such as contaminated sheets, clothes or needlespregnant persons, who may pass the virus on to their unborn baby. If you have mpox: Tell anyone you have been close to recentlyStay at home until all scabs fall off and a new layer of skin formsCover lesions and wear a well-fitting mask when around other peopleAvoid physical contact. The disease mpox (formerly monkeypox) is caused by the monkeypox virus (commonly abbreviated as MPXV), an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus of theOrthopoxvirusgenus in thePoxviridaefamily, which includes variola, cowpox, vaccinia and other viruses. The two genetic clades of the virus are clades I and II. The monkeypox virus was discovered in Denmark (1958) in monkeys kept for research and the first reported human case of mpox was a nine-month-old boy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC, 1970). Mpox can spread from person to person or occasionally from animals to people. Following eradication of smallpox in 1980 and the end of smallpox vaccination worldwide, mpox steadily emerged in central, east and west Africa. A global outbreak occurred in 2022–2023. The natural reservoir of the virus is unknown – various small mammals such as squirrels and monkeys are susceptible."
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox,Transmission,"Person-to-person transmission of mpox can occur through direct contact with infectious skin or other lesions such as in the mouth or on genitals; this includes contact which is face-to-face (talking or breathing)skin-to-skin (touching or vaginal/anal sex)mouth-to-mouth (kissing)mouth-to-skin contact (oral sex or kissing the skin)respiratory droplets or short-range aerosols from prolonged close contact The virus then enters the body through broken skin, mucosal surfaces (e g oral, pharyngeal, ocular, genital, anorectal), or via the respiratory tract. Mpox can spread to other members of the household and to sex partners. People with multiple sexual partners are at higher risk. Animal to human transmission of mpox occurs from infected animals to humans from bites or scratches, or during activities such as hunting, skinning, trapping, cooking, playing with carcasses, or eating animals.The extent of viral circulation in animal populations is not entirely known and further studies are underway. People can contract mpox from contaminated objects such as clothing or linens, through sharps injuries in health care, or in community setting such as tattoo parlours."
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox,Signs and symptoms,"Mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within a week but can start 1–21 days after exposure. Symptoms typically last 2–4 weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system. Common symptoms of mpox are: rashfeversore throatheadachemuscle achesback painlow energyswollen lymph nodes. For some people, the first symptom of mpox is a rash, while others may have different symptoms first. The rash begins as a flat sore which develops into a blister filled with liquid and may be itchy or painful. As the rash heals, the lesions dry up, crust over and fall off. Some people may have one or a few skin lesions and others have hundreds or more. These can appear  anywhere on the body such as the: palms of hands and soles of feetface, mouth and throatgroin and genital areasanus. Some people also have painful swelling of their rectum or pain and difficulty when peeing. People with mpox are infectious and can pass the disease on to others until all sores have healed and a new layer of skin has formed. Children, pregnant people and people with weak immune systems are at risk for complications from mpox. Typically for mpox, fever, muscle aches and sore throat appear first. The mpox rash begins on the face and spreads over the body, extending to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and evolves over 2-4 weeks in stages – macules, papules, vesicles, pustules. Lesions dip in the centre before crusting over. Scabs then fall off. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is a classic feature of mpox. Some people can be infected without developing any symptoms. In the context of the global outbreak of mpox which began in 2022 (caused mostly by Clade IIb virus), the illness begins differently in some people. In just over a half of cases, a rash may appear before or at the same time as other symptoms and does not always progress over the body. The first lesion can be in the groin, anus, or in or around the mouth. People with mpox can become very sick. For example, the skin can become infected with bacteria leading to abscesses or serious skin damage. Other complications include pneumonia, corneal infection with loss of vision; pain or difficulty swallowing, vomiting and diarrhoea causing severe dehydration or malnutrition; sepsis (infection of the blood with a widespread inflammatory response in the body), inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), heart (myocarditis), rectum (proctitis), genital organs (balanitis) or urinary passages (urethritis), or death. Persons with immune suppression due to medication or medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death due to mpox. People living with HIV that is not well-controlled or treated more often develop severe disease."

https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox,Diagnosis,"Identifying mpox can be difficult as other infections and conditions can look similar. It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmissible infections, and medication-associated allergies. Someone with mpox may also have another sexually transmissible infection such as herpes. Alternatively, a child with suspected mpox may also have chickenpox. For these reasons, testing is key for people to get treatment as early as possible and prevent further spread. Detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred laboratory test for mpox. The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash – skin, fluid or crusts – collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done on oropharyngeal, anal or rectal swabs. Testing blood is not recommended. Antibody detection methods may not be useful as they do not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses. More information on laboratory confirmation of mpox can be foundhere."
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox,Treatment and vaccination,"The goal of treating mpox is to take care of the rash, manage pain and prevent complications. Early and supportive care is important to help manage symptoms and avoid further problems. Getting an mpox vaccine can help prevent infection. The vaccine should be given within 4 days of contact with someone who has mpox (or within up to 14 days if there are no symptoms). It is recommended for people at high risk to get vaccinated to prevent infection with mpox, especially during an outbreak. This includes: health workers at risk of exposuremen who have sex with menpeople with multiple sex partnerssex workers. Persons who have mpox should be cared for away from other people. Several antivirals, such as tecovirimat, originally developed to treat smallpox have been used to treat mpox and further studies are underway. Further information is available on mpoxvaccinationandcase management."
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox,Self-care and prevention,"Most people with mpox will recover within 2–4 weeks. Things to do to help the symptoms and prevent infecting others: Do stay home and in your      own room if possiblewash hands often with      soap and water or hand sanitizer, especially before or after touching      soreswear a mask and cover      lesions when around other people until your rash healskeep skin dry and      uncovered (unless in a room with someone else)avoid touching items      in shared spaces and disinfect shared spaces frequentlyuse saltwater rinses      for sores in the mouthtake sitz baths or      warm baths with baking soda or Epsom salts for body sorestake over-the-counter      medications for pain like paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. Do not pop blisters or      scratch sores, which can slow healing, spread the rash to other parts of      the body, and cause sores to become infected; orshave areas with sores      until scabs have healed and you have new skin underneath (this can spread      the rash to other parts of the body). To prevent spread of mpox to others, persons with mpox should isolate at home, or in hospital if needed, for the duration of the infectious period (from onset of symptoms until lesions have healed and scabs fall off). Covering lesions and wearing a medical mask when in the presence of others may help prevent spread. Using condoms during sex will help reduce the risk getting mpox but will not prevent spread from skin-to-skin or mouth-to-skin contact."
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox,Outbreaks,"After 1970, mpox occurred sporadically in Central and East Africa (clade I) and West Africa (clade II). In 2003 an outbreak in the United States of America was linked to imported wild animals (clade II). Since 2005, thousands of suspected cases are reported in the DRC every year. In 2017, mpox re-emerged in Nigeria and continues to spread between people across the country and in travellers to other destinations. Data on cases reported up to 2021 are availablehere. In May 2022, an outbreak of mpox appeared suddenly and rapidly spread across Europe, the Americas and then all six WHO regions, with 110 countries reporting about 87 thousand cases and 112 deaths. The global outbreak has affected primarily (but not only) gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and has spread person-to-person through sexual networks. More information on the global outbreak is availableherewith detailed outbreak datahere; In 2022, outbreaks of mpox due to Clade I MPXV occurred in refugee camps in the Republic of the Sudan. A zoonotic origin has not been found."
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/monkeypox,WHO response,"The global outbreak of mpox was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 23 of July 2022. WHO published astrategic preparedness and response planfor mpox and a suite oftechnical guidancedocuments.  Surveillance, diagnostics, risk communication and community engagement remain central to stopping the outbreak and eliminating human-to-human transmission of mpox in all contexts. More information can be foundhere. Questions and answers arehereand public health advice ishere."
